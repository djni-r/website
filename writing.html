    			<h3>Problems and solutions, or how to be happy</h3>
    			<p class="blog-date">November 29, 2019</p>
    			<div class="blog-body">
    				<p>It's a simple post.</p>
    				<p>When you're cold, you need warmth; when hot, you need a breeze; when hungry, you need food; when full, you need a break; when poor, you need money; when rich, you need a simple life; after work you need rest; after rest you need activity; when tired you need sleep; after sleep you need wakefullness...</p>
    				<p>The first group is called problems, the second - solutions.</p>
    				<p>To be happy, you need to not let the problems last for too long without finding, or rather, be open to solutions.</p>
    				<p>Problems continuing for too long, produce anxeity and despair; a solution continuing for too long after the problem has been solved, produces new problems.</p>
    				<p>Of course, either one running for too long, can be a learning device for understanding the balance, but in the end it comes to this. After this, however, there is no duality.</p>

		  		<h3>Playing Overwatch, or how to move forward</h3>
		  		<p class="blog-date">October 15, 2019</p>
		  		<div class="blog-body">
		    		<p>I decided to take a walk to work, instead of the usual bike ride, and got into thinking mood. I was thinking how I understood better how to play a tank character in Overwatch. If you're not playing it might be harder to understand, but the gist of it is, there are two teams, and they confront each other in one way or another. Each team has tank, damage, and support characters; tanks are heavier and usually have some kind of barrier to protect the team, the damage does mostly killing and shoooting, and support heals the teammates.</p>
		    		<p>So at some point of playing, I understood that while playing a tankcharacter, you have to constantly move the frontline forward. You move forward, then place a barrier, and let the team behind you shoot and support you. If you don't do this moving forward, and other team members don't either, you might be able to fight off the opposite team, but you'll stay at the same place, and will not move forward. Since there is a time limit, that wouldn't work, so you need this, as I would call it, leap of faith, where you might get hurt by the opposite team, but you have to move nevertheless, and trust that other team members would support you. And what I found is, that often it works very well, and the opposite team backs up even if it seems like you're bluffing. Of course, if you try to go too fast, it might not work as well, and no matter what, sometimes you would lose anyway, but the idea got into my head nevertheless.</p>
		    		<p>I like to draw parallels between different aspects of human existence. I do it all the time. And so I did with this idea of pushing forward and making this leap of faith in the game. In the world, if you're trying to push something forward, whether improve your situation or become someone or anything really, you have to do this moving forward, otherwise you'll just stay in the same position, even doing seemingly fine. You need to make leaps of faith and trust that those around you would do their job and so as a team you'd move forward. Time clicks for everyone, and one has to move forward constantly. Of course, there will be times you'll lose, after all others need to win too. There are more nuances to this, but it's a nice parallel.</p>
		    		<p>The last thing we always need to remember, is that it's just a game. No matter what happens, it'll be over, and when you get back to reality, you are as you have always been, the game did nothing to you or anyone around you. If you forget that and get into it too much, it becomes hard to control yourself and your feelings and things go not as they were planned, seemingly.</p>

					<h3>About Hong Kong, China, the West, democracy and freedom</h3>
					<p class="blog-date">October 10, 2019</p>
		  		<div class="blog-body">
		    		<p>Doesn’t it make sense that Hong Kong protest movement is a “separatist” movement (without its condemnation)? The protesters are trying to separate themselves from the “communist” China (which is communist only in its name and image, in fact in many aspects it’s more capitalist than the West) in the name of democracy. And as such, Chinese government response is understandable; no government can tolerate “separatist” movements. We saw it in Spain, Ukraine, Turkey, and many other places. The thing is, when such movement is directed towards the western values, a.k.a democracy, it’s seen as good by the West, and so is to be supported, otherwise it must be condemned, which is of course extremely biased towards the West.</p>

		    		<p>The West needs to finally understand that democracy is not the only way to govern. Period. Every country has its own specifics, and trying to force everyone into one democratic box is just not right. You’re saying, oh but freedom is above all else. Well, you’re seeing democracy as freedom, but is it really? Is being able to choose between left and right every four/five years really freedom? Americans chose their “leader of the free world”, and how do they feel about that? British chose their way. And how is this working out? Then they say, it’s not us, it’s them. Someone else chose it, those stupid people. We didn’t vote for him. We wanted to remain. Well, at least this illusion of freedom doesn’t concern the Chinese. Americans will say, we’ll vote him out. Will they be happy? Maybe for a few days, and more excited than happy, because true happiness, like freedom, does not depend on someone being voted in our out of office. Other issues will come up, and anyway someone else will be saying, they took our vote. It’ll go on like that as long as the system continues. Then perhaps a different one will come, and it’ll have its own issues.</p>
		    		
		    		<p>By the way, I thought Trump should be elected when the election was happening. Why not, if that’s allowed by the system? I thought that would be interesting to watch. I can see now that it was selfish of me. But hey, it’s democracy.</p>
		    		
		    		<p>Does it mean I agree with everything Chinese government does? Not at all. I don’t think enforcement always works. It does sometimes. Other times, letting others make their own choices or even mistakes is better. And sometimes those mistakes might be not mistakes at all.  Every situation is different, and trying to force one rule on everything is the same as trying to force democracy on every country.</p>

		    		<p>There is much more to this, but that’s the gist of it, so I’ll finish here, and perhaps continue later, or maybe not.</p>
