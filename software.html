	  <h4>Visual & sound improvisation</h4>
	  <p>June 2019</p>
	  <p>The program generates music and linear movement until it arrives at the initial coordinate that it started from. While the image is generated, it can be saved, however at the very last moment when it reaches the initial/ending point, the memory of the objects is deleted, and the image becomes a white background. Because of the semi-random nature of the movement, it's hard to determine when it will end, it may be few minutes, few hours, or few weeks.</p>
	  <p>The idea of a constant search and getting back to the beginning has almost a spiritual dimension, with information being readily available but true knowledge seeming always intangible. Hence, as soon as we get back to the original position of where the work started, the whole memory of it is wiped out and there is no way to capture it in form.</p>

	  <p>Each note corresponds to a particular color of the specter, e.g. A is red, B is orange, C is yellow, etc. Size and position are chosen at random. The result reminds of Piet Mondrian's geometric paintings, except every moment the new one is created and the one before never exists again. In addition pauses erase parts of the painting creating back and forth movement of making and ereasure of the picture.</p>

	  <h4>Sound improvisation</h4>
	  <p>2018</p>
	  <p>Essentially it is a software that improvises, i.e. goes between random notes and responses to the notes that were played before, given certain sounds and rules. The rules are hardcoded, but the choices of the notes happen on a stochastic basis, meaning based on probabilities.</p>
	  <p>I'm using programming as a tool for creating things new. Every time I start the program, I do not know what notes will be chosen. Every set is unique, never repeated. Thus, can one say it's a creation of Artificial Intelligence? The work of the artist is the contruction of the maker. Who is the creator then, the artist or the machine? Or can it not be seen apart?</p>
