<h3>Artist statement</h3>
<p>There is nothing I can do about art to change its course. I only follow my intuition and intellect in making of what I believe to be of value. The world is closer and closer to the recognition of its own illusory quality, and I don't want to interfere with it, only speed it up, if possible. My job is to be a witness rather than a participant.</p>
<p>The questions that I ask are following. Are we the programmers or are we the users? When an artist programs a computer to improvise, is the art made by the artist or the computer, and what is the artist's art? Can a decision be art?</p>
